        <h1>COFFEE RECIPE</h1>
        <h4>Coffee is a popular beverage enjoyed worldwide, made from roasted coffee beans. The beans come from the seeds of coffee cherries, which are harvested from coffee plants. There are various coffee species, each contributing to the diverse flavors and aromas found in different types of coffee. The coffee-making process involves several steps, from growing and harvesting the beans to roasting and brewing. Common brewing methods include drip coffee, espresso, French press, and pour-over. Coffee is known for its stimulating effects, primarily due to the presence of caffeine, a natural stimulant. It has a rich cultural history and plays a significant role in social interactions. Coffee enthusiasts appreciate the wide range of flavors, from fruity and floral to nutty and chocolatey, depending on factors like bean origin, roast level, and brewing technique. Overall, coffee is a versatile and beloved beverage that brings people together and provides a comforting and energizing experience.

      <h2>HISTORY OF COFFEE</h2>
      <p><h5>The history of coffee begins in Ethiopia in the 9th century, according to legend, when a goat herder named Kaldi discovered the energizing effects of coffee beans. The knowledge of coffee spread to the Arab world, where coffee cultivation and trade began in the 15th century. By the 17th century, coffee had reached Europe, and coffeehouses became popular social hubs.</h5></p>
      <p><h5>In the Ottoman Empire, coffee became integral to the culture, and the Ottoman Turks introduced it to Europe during their siege of Vienna in 1683. Coffee cultivation expanded to the Americas in the 18th century, with Gabriel de Clieu bringing a coffee plant to Martinique. The 19th century saw the rise of coffee plantations, particularly in Brazil, and the development of processing techniques.</h5></p>
      <p><h5>The 20th century brought industrialization and the introduction of instant coffee, making coffee more convenient. In recent decades, there has been a focus on specialty coffee, with an emphasis on high-quality beans and unique brewing methods. Today, coffee is a globally consumed beverage, with a rich cultural significance and a diverse array of varieties and preparation methods.</h5></p>
